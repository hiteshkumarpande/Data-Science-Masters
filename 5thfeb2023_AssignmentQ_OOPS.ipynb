The child class method overrides the method inherited from the parent class, when called with the child class object. This kind of implementation is called method overriding. Below, we have a parent class called Cars, and child classes that inherit from the parent class. Notice that all the classes (base class and child classes) have the same method called start. However, the start methods in the child classes have been modified to fit the 'needs' of that child class.
