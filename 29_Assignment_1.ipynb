    "1.\tWho developed Python Programming Language?\n",
    "Python was created by Guido van Rossum and first released on February 20, 1991.\n",
    "2.\tWhich type of Programming does Python support?\n",
    "Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high level dynamic data types, and classes.\n",
    "3.\tIs Python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers?\n",
    "Yes, Python is a case-sensitive programming language, this means that it considers uppercase and lowercase letters differently.\n",
    "4.\tWhat is the correct extension of the Python file?\n",
    "Pyc: This is the file extension for compiled Python code files. When a .py file is executed, the Python interpreter compiles the code to bytecode and saves it in a.pyc file to improve performance on subsequent executions.\n",
    "5.\tIs Python code compiled or Interpreted?\n",
    "Python is an interpreted language, which means the source code of a Python program is converted into bytecode that is then executed by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM).\n",
    "6.\tName a few blocks of code used to define in Python language?\n",
    "For Example:\n",
    "\tif (condition):\n",
    "    # Statement 1\n",
    "    # Statement 2\n",
    "    # Statement 3\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # Statement 4\n",
    "    # Statement 5\n",
    "    # Statement 6\n",
    "You will find that statements 1,2,3 will have the same indentation and therefore is of the same block. And similarly, statements 4,5,6 is of an another block.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.\tState a character used to give single-line comments in Python language?\n",
    "Single line comments are those comments which are written without giving a line break or newline in python. A python comment is written by initializing the text of comment with a # and terminates when the end of line is encountered. The following example shows a single line comment in a program where a function is defined to add a number and its square to a python dictionary as key value pair.\n",
    "8.\tMention functions which can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on?\n",
    "Check Python version on Command Line: python --version\n",
    "For Python 3, use the following command:\n",
    "python3 --version\n",
    "9.\tPython supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime, using a constructor called ?\n",
    "--> Lambda.\n",
    "10.\tWhat does pip stand for python?\n",
    "---> The most popular package manager for Python is pip. Developed in 2008, pip (an acronym of “pip Install Packages”) is today the standard tool for installing Python packages and their dependencies in a secure manner. Most recent distributions of Python come with pip preinstalled. Python 2.7.9 and Python 3.4 and later versions include pip by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pip is a powerful and user-friendly tool that allows you to manage Python packages using a handful of commands. Although pip uses PyPi as a default repository for fetching packages, it has also the capability to install packages from other sources, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Version control systems like Github, Mercurial, Subversion, and Bazaar.\n",
    "    Requirements files. Usually, Python packages require multiple packages to run. To install all the necessary packages at once, pip uses the so-called requirements.txt, which contains a list of the necessary packages, as well as the correct versions.\n",
    "    Distribution files. These are versioned, ready-to-install files containing Python packages, modules, and other resource files necessary for a package to function. They come in two forms:\n",
    "        Source distribution (usually shortened to “sdist”)\n",
    "        Wheel distribution (usually shortened to “wheel”)\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use pip and start managing packages, you first need to ensure that it's installed on your computer. To check whether pip is available, run one of the following statements in the command line:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>pip3 --version\n",
    "\n",
    ">>pip --version\n",
    "11. Mention a few built-in functions in pythons?\n",
    "--->Python has several functions that are readily available for use. These functions are called built-in functions. \n",
    "a) Python abs()-->The abs() function returns the absolute value of the given number. If the number is a complex number, abs() returns its magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "number = -20\n",
    "\n",
    "absolute_number = abs(number)\n",
    "print(absolute_number)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output: 20\n",
    "b) Python all()-->returns true when all elements in iterable is true.\n",
    "Example\n",
    "boolean_list = ['True', 'True', 'True']\n",
    "\n",
    "# check if all elements are true\n",
    "result = all(boolean_list)\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output: True\n",
    "c) Python any()-->Checks if any Element of an Iterable is True.\n",
    "The any() function returns True if any element of an iterable is True. If not, it returns False.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "boolean_list = ['True', 'False', 'True']\n",
    "\n",
    "# check if any element is true\n",
    "result = any(boolean_list)\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output: True\n",
    "d) Python ascii()-->Returns String Containing Printable Representation.\n",
    "The ascii() method replaces a non-printable character with its corresponding ascii value and returns it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "text = 'Pythön is interesting'\n",
    "\n",
    "# replace ö with its ascii value\n",
    "print(ascii(text))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output: 'Pyth\\xf6n is interesting'\n",
    "e) Python bin()-->converts integer to binary string.\n",
    "The bin() method converts a specified integer number to its binary representation and returns it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "number = 15\n",
    "\n",
    "# convert 15 to its binary equivalent \n",
    "print('The binary equivalent of 15 is', bin(number))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output: The binary equivalent of 15 is 0b1111\n",
    "f)Python bool()--->Converts a Value to Boolean.\n",
    "The bool() method takes a specified argument and returns its boolean value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example-\n",
    "test = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "# returns boolean value of 1\n",
    "print(test, 'is', bool(test))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output: 1 is True\n",
    "\n",
    "12. What is the maximum possible length of an identifier in Python?\n",
    "In Python, the highest possible length of an identifier is 79 characters. Python is a high level programming language. It’s also a complex form and a collector of waste.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What are the benefits of using Python?\n",
    "--> There are a plethora of benefits to developing software in the Python programming language. We will highlight the major benefits below, with a brief explanation of the advantages of choosing Python for each one.\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Python is Extensible\n",
    "    Python on its own is a powerful programming language, but there is always room for improvement. That being said, Python is highly extensible, meaning that you can extend Python to other languages and write C#, C, C++, Java, and other programming languages within your Python codebase to add functionality or blend it with other software.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Python Libraries\n",
    "    Speaking of adding functionality to Python – one of the major benefits of choosing Python as your programming language of choice (or even adding it as a second or third language) is the large amount of libraries you can incorporate into your code. A library is basically a piece of reusable code that can be used for common functions such as manipulating images, performing equations, database administration, regular expressions, and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries help reduce coding errors, make programmers more efficient, and make software smaller in size (and lines of code). Instead of writing long lines of code to accomplish a common task, coders can simply call upon a library – often with a single line of code – to perform that task instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, when we use the phrase “library” here, we are using it interchangeably with modules and packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Python Community\n",
    "    Without a doubt, one of the most important benefits of Python is its vast community of developers and software engineers. This community helps support Python – and thus Python developers – in numerous ways. For starters, they help the language grow and expand, as new iterations of the programming language rely on community support to add functionality and find flaws in new versions. They also actively contribute to learning resources, like Python tutorials, guides, books, forum discussions, and video content.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the Python community creates libraries and plugins that expand what can be achieved with the language. Since the Python community is so large, it also ensures the language continues to exist and that companies continue to adapt Python into their developer stacks and technologies. That means more Python jobs and more users to purchase the Python software you develop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python Is Easy to Learn\n",
    "Python is incredibly easy to learn, regardless of your age or experience level. It is part of the reason I wrote a book about programming in the language for teenagers – it is a great entry into programming software as a whole. Since the language is so simple to read and write in, it also makes a great second or third language to add to your developer resume.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if a programmer plans on coding in a different language further down the line, Python is a good place to start. You can learn basic programming philosophies and concepts that overlap no matter what language you use. For example, pretty much every programming language uses the concepts of variables, data types, loops and iterations, and control statements like if and else.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. How is memory managed in Python?\n",
    "--> According to the Python memory management documentation, Python has a private heap that stores our program’s objects and data structures. Python memory manager takes care of the bulk of the memory management work and allows us to concentrate on our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of memory allocation\n",
    "There are two types of memory allocation in Python, static and dynamic.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Static memory\n",
    "The stack data structure provides static memory allocation, meaning the variables are in the stack memory. Statically assigned variables, as the name implies, are permanent; this means that they must be allocated in advance and persist for the duration of the program. Another point to remember is that we cannot reuse the memory allocated in the stack memory. Therefore, memory reusability is not possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "123\n",
    "x = 20\n",
    "y = [] \n",
    "z = \"\" \n",
    "2. Dynamic memory\n",
    "The dynamic memory allocation uses heap data structures in its implementation, implying that variables are in the heap memory. As the name suggests, dynamically allocated variables are not permanent and can be changed while a program is running. Additionally, allotted memory can be relinquished and reused. However, it takes longer to complete because dynamic memory allocation occurs during program execution. Furthermore, after utilizing the allocated memory, we must release it. Otherwise, problems such as memory leaks might arise.\n",
    "\n",
    "1 x = [0]*5  #This memory for 5 integers is allocated on heap.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Python garbage collection\n",
    "The Python garbage collector handles memory allocation and deallocation automatically in Python. Python developers have designed it to eliminate the need for manual garbage collection. Garbage collection in Python refers to the interpreter’s memory management process of freeing up unneeded and undesired memory for our applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Python uses garbage collection to release memory blocks no longer in use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The garbage collector (GC) operates in the background and is triggered when the reference count reaches zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reference count rises when the following occur:\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is given a new name\n",
    "An object is placed in a container, such as a tuple or a dictionary\n",
    "The reference count lowers when the following occurs:\n",
    "\n",
    "An object’s reference is reassigned\n",
    "An object’s reference moves out of scope\n",
    "An object is removed\n",
    "The memory is a heap that stores the program’s objects and other data structures. The Python memory manager uses API methods to handle the allocation and deallocation of this heap space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see a basic example of how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "123456\n",
    "class Test(object):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "x = Test()\n",
    "x.obj = x\n",
    "del x\n",
    "We create a new Class in the example above. After that, we created an instance of the class and made it a property of itself. Finally, we remove the instance from the system.  The instance is no longer available in our Python application when we delete it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how to use the gc module in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "123\n",
    "import gc\n",
    "print(gc.get_threshold())\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Run\n",
    "As we can see, we import the gc module and print the garbage collection thresholds. From the output, Python has a threshold of 700 for the youngest generation and 10 for each two older generations by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may use the get_count() method to get the number of objects in each of our generations:\n",
    "\n",
    "123\n",
    "import gc\n",
    "print(gc.get_count())\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Run\n",
    "The gc.collect() method returns the number of collected and deallocated items.\n",
    "\n",
    "12\n",
    "import gc\n",
    "print(gc.collect())\n",
    "\n",
    "Run\n",
    "The set_threshold() method allows us to change the garbage collection thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "12345678\n",
    "import gc\n",
    "\n",
    "gc.get_threshold()\n",
    "gc.set_threshold(7777, 11, 11)\n",
    "print(gc.get_threshold())\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Run\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "While Python takes care of most memory management for us, it’s still helpful to understand what’s going on under the curtain. We covered how memory is managed in Python in this Answer. We began by going over the fundamentals of memory management and the various forms of memory allocation. \n",
